- CLASS DESCRIPTION -

Dialogue: This class contains lenghty messages so I don't overload the main 
program too much;

PriceComparator: This class is a comparator used to sort destinations based on 
the average price/day;

Main: In the beggining of the program I create an array of Destination-type 
objects which will contain all destinations and their stats(name, city, etc);
	Alongside this ArrayList I have two more ArrayLists (LiteralCity and 
LiteralCountry) which are only used for printing the entire lists of cities and
countries. This is necessary because the user must insert the names exactly as
they are written in the list(just a little bit of user-proofing :) ).
 	I also declare two HashMaps: 
-Cities, which contains all city names mapped with lists of all destinations 
available in each city;
-Countries, which will contain all country names mapped with a list of all 
cities in each country as strings;

This way of storing data allows for code extension. If i want to add another 
level in the hierarchy, lets say continent, all I have to do is create another
HashMap of Strings and in the moment of reading data, I must add all countries 
to their corresponding continents. By using a HashMap, when I'm searching for a 
destination in a certain continent I can get all the countries(and then cities)
from that respective continent in O(1 + no_of_countries * no_of_cities), rather
than O(no_of_continents * no_of_countries * no_of_cities);

After this process, I start interracting with the user by listing all available
 options and asking for input. Based on what input I receive one of the
 follwing will take place:
1. I itterate through my list of destinations and when I find the one the user 
requested I print it's stats;
2. I ask the user for filtering options(city/country/visiting dates) and I 
apply these options to my list of destinations( getting the destinations from 
a certain city/country is not costly due to the HashMaps). After that I sort 
the resulting list using the comparator described earlier and print top 5 
locations.
3. I iterate through the list of destinations and I add to a list the ones 
where the requested activity is available.
4. The program is running continuously until the user is done. When the input 
is 4, the program exits gracefully.
